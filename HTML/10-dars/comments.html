    <h1 style="color:red;text-align:center">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
    <p style="color:green ;opacity:0.9 ;">
        <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
        <br> specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br> electronic typesetting,<br> remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised <br> in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
        passages,
        <br> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including <br> versions of Lorem Ipsum </p>

    <h1 style="color: red;text-align:center">Why do we use it?</h1>
    <p style="color: green;">
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content<br> of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more,<br> -or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
        <b>'Content here,content here'</b>,<br> making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors <br> now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover<br> many web
        sites still in their infancy.Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes<br> by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

        Where does it come from?

        <i>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</i> It has roots in a piece of <br> classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin<br> professor at Hampden-Sydney College
        in Virginia, looked upone of the more obscure Latin words,<br> consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical <br> literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32
        and 1.10.33
        <br> of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. <br> This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first <br> line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
        sit amet..",comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard<br> chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 <br> and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
        in their<br> exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration <br> in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are<br> going to use a passage
        of Lorem Ipsum,you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing<sup>hidden</sup> in the middle<br> of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making <br> this the first true generator
        on the Internet. <del>It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words,</del> combined with a <br> handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum<br> is therefore always free from repetition,
        injected <sub>humour</sub>, or non-characteristic words etc.
